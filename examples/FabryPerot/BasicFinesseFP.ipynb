    "PyTickle has several functions that make building a Finesse model more convenient and similar to Optickle model building. These functions just make a regular PyKat kat model. Any kat model made by any means outside of PyTickle, for example by using PyKat to parse classic Finesse code, can be used with its analysis functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most Finesse model building functions have analogs in PyTickle. Just as in Finesse, components are added with nodes and the nodes are connected with spaces. Using PyTickle's model building functions enforces standardized node naming conventions which the user does not have to think about. One consequence is that the behavior of the model will never depend on the order in which components are defined or in which spaces are added.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the `addMirror(kat, 'mirr')` function adds a mirror named `'mirr'` to the model `kat` with a set of default parameters and defines the nodes `mirr_fr` and `mirr_bk` for the front and back of the mirror, respectively. Most functions have doc strings, so the usage, default parameters, and node names can be found easily using, for example, `help(fin.addMirror)`."
