# Fabry Perot Examples

* The BasicFinesseFP and BasicOptickleFP notebooks demonstrate the basic PyTickle functionality by setting up a Fabry Perot cavity, computing frequency response, response to sweeping drives, and extraction of zpk and state space representations.
* The FinesseTorsionalSpring and OptickleTorsionalSpring notebooks add the dynamics of mirrors to compute the radiation pressure effects on the dynamics of mirrors.
