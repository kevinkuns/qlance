Conceptually it can be broken down into a radiation pressure \"loop suppression function\" $R$ which modifies the mechanical response of mirrors and an optical plant $P_\\mathrm{opt}$ which only includes the optical response. See below for details.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * The input matrix $I$ defines which probes are used to sense each DOF.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * The control filters $C$ define the feedback and feedforward dynamics of the loop.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * The output matrix $O$ defines which combinations of drives make up each DOF.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * The actuation function $A$ is the transfer function from the point that the control loop actuates on each drive to the motion of that drive. In the example of a multi-stage suspension used for a test mass mirror, the position of the mirror may be actuated on by applying a force on the stage above rather than on the mirror itself. The function $A$ is then the mechanical plant from forces on this stage to test mass motion.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * The compensation filters $K$ invert the actuation plants with the goal to make $AK\\approx \\mathbb{1}$. (In practice the entire block $KOCI$ can be thought of as the (possibly digital) controller, but it is more convenient to break this up as shown in the diagram above.)\n",

    "    * The difference between the $x_\\mathrm{drive}$ and $x_\\mathrm{pos}$ test points is described in detail below, but can be understood simply as follows. The effects of radiation pressure can be thought of as a feedback loop. The block $R$ is the closed loop transfer function of this radiation pressure loop, $x_\\mathrm{drive}$ is the input signal to the loop, and $x_\\mathrm{pos}$ is the output signal from the loop.\n",
    "    * The name used in PyTickle to refer to each test point is the same as the subscript in the figure. So, for example, to compute the transfer function from $d_\\mathrm{err}$ to $x_\\mathrm{pos}$, you'd use `cs.getTF(sig_to, pos, sig_from, err)`\n",

The convenience function `getTotalNoiseTo` does this automatically.
