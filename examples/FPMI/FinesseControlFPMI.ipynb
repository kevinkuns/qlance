Conceptually it can be broken down into a radiation pressure \"loop suppression function\" $R$ which modifies the mechanical response of mirrors and an optical plant $P_\\mathrm{opt}$ which only includes the optical response. See below for details.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * The input matrix $I$ defines which probes are used to sense each DOF.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * The control filters $C$ define the feedback and feedforward dynamics of the loop.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * The output matrix $O$ defines which combinations of drives make up each DOF.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * The actuation function $A$ is the transfer function from the point that the control loop actuates on each drive to the motion of that drive. In the example of a multi-stage suspension used for a test mass mirror, the position of the mirror may be actuated on by applying a force on the stage above rather than on the mirror itself. The function $A$ is then the mechanical plant from forces on this stage to test mass motion.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * The compensation filters $K$ invert the actuation plants with the goal to make $AK\\approx \\mathbb{1}$. (In practice the entire block $KOCI$ can be thought of as the (possibly digital) controller, but it is more convenient to break this up as shown in the diagram above.)\n",

The effects of radiation pressure can be thought of as a feedback loop. The block $R$ is the closed loop transfer function of this radiation pressure loop, $x_\\mathrm{drive}$ is the input signal to the loop, and $x_\\mathrm{pos}$ is the output signal from the loop.\n",
    "    * The name used in QLANCE to refer to each test point is the same as the subscript in the figure. So, for example, to compute the transfer function from $d_\\mathrm{err}$ to $x_\\mathrm{pos}$, you'd use `cs.getTF(sig_to, pos, sig_from, err)`\n",
